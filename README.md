# GemEngine

GemEngine is a 2D graphic engine based on SDL2.



## Why GemEngine

With GemEngine I try to write a base to create graphic portable applications.
To accomplish that I try to use as much standard libraries as possible, like SDL2 and a general use language like C++.

## Features covered so far

This is a pretty new project so I'm covering so far:

 - Physical and Virtual screen allowing to create retro like pixelation effects.
 - Text Console with methods to locate cursor on console and write bitmapped fonts.
 - Image load
 - Animated Sprites
 - Wired Triangles
 - Filled Triangles (with clipping)


## Whats comes next
I hope a lot more
